# network-scan-and-analysis
This project performs a comprehensive scan of a local network using **Nmap** and analyzes the resulting packet traffic with **Wireshark**. 
It is part of a cybersecurity learning task designed to understand port visibility, service identification, and packet-level behavior of active scanning.

## 🎯 Objective

- Discover devices and open ports in a local subnet
- Identify common and potentially vulnerable services
- Capture and analyze packet-level behavior using Wireshark
- Document findings and suggest basic security measures

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Nmap** – for network and port scanning
- **Wireshark** – for live packet capture and protocol analysis 
- **Kali Linux** – as the operating system for running tools
