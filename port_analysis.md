# üîç Port & Service Analysis

## üß† What Are Ports in Networking?
Think of ports as doors on your device. When data wants to come in or go out of your computer (like visiting a website or sending a message), it uses a specific port number to know which application or service should handle that data.

Every internet-connected device has 65,535 ports (numbered from 0 to 65535). These ports don‚Äôt physically exist ‚Äî they‚Äôre logical communication channels managed by your operating system.

üõé Example Analogy:
Let‚Äôs say you live in a big building (your computer). There are many rooms (apps/services) like:

üìû A phone room for calls (Port 5060 for SIP)

üìß A mailroom for emails (Port 25 for SMTP)

üåê A lobby for visitors (Port 80 for HTTP websites)

üîê A private office with a security guard (Port 22 for SSH)



When someone sends you a message, the message must go to the correct room (service) through the right door (port).

üì¨ Two Types of Ports:


TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) :  	Reliable and ensures delivery :  	Web, SSH, FTP


UDP (User Datagram Protocol) : 	Faster but less reliable :  	Streaming, DNS

--- 

üéØ Why Are Ports Important in Cybersecurity?


üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Hackers scan open ports to find weak services.

üîì Misconfigured or forgotten ports can leak data or be exploited.

üí° Tools like Nmap let you check which ports are open and what they‚Äôre doing.



This document provides a manual analysis of the ports discovered during the Nmap scan. 
Understanding what services run on open ports helps evaluate the risk and identify potential vulnerabilities in your network.

## üõ† Ports Identified in Scan

From our TCP SYN scan (using `nmap -sS`), we observed the following open ports:

| Port | Protocol | Service        | Description                                         |
|------|----------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| 135  | TCP      | msrpc          | Microsoft RPC - Remote communication between apps   |
| 139  | TCP      | netbios-ssn    | NetBIOS Session Service - Legacy file/printer share |
| 445  | TCP      | microsoft-ds   | SMB over TCP - File sharing and network logins      |

## üîç What This Port Table Means:
Think of your computer (or any device) as a building with many doors. Each port is like a door that allows certain types of communication to enter or leave the system.

This table tells you:

| Column                                    | What It Means                                                                                                            |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Port**                                  | The number assigned to a "door" on a device. Each port handles a specific service (like email, web, file sharing, etc.). |
| **Protocol**                              | The type of communication used ‚Äî usually **TCP** (reliable) or **UDP** (faster but no guarantee).                        |
| **Service**                               | The name of the service usually running on that port ‚Äî like **HTTP** for websites or **SSH** for remote login.           |
| **Description / Vulnerability Potential** | Describes if the port/service is risky, outdated, or commonly attacked ‚Äî and why you should be careful with it.          |


üéì Example:


Let‚Äôs take one row and explain it:

| **Port** | **Protocol** | **Service** | **Description / Vulnerability Potential** |
| -------- | ------------ | ----------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 22       | TCP          | SSH         | Target for brute-force attacks            |

- Port 22 is like a door to your system.

- It uses TCP to ensure the messages are sent properly.

- The service running here is SSH ‚Äî used to remotely log in to your computer.

- But it's also a common target for hackers trying to guess your password!


So, if you're not using SSH, you should close this door (block or disable it) to stay safe.

## üîé Port-by-Port Breakdown

### üîπ **Port 135/tcp ‚Äì msrpc**
- **Name**: Microsoft Remote Procedure Call (MSRPC)
- **Purpose**: Enables communication between applications/services across systems.
- **Risks**:
  - Often exploited by malware and attackers.
  - Can be used for remote code execution (e.g., DCOM).
- **Recommendation**:
  - Block externally via firewall.
  - Only allow internally if required by Windows services.

---

### üîπ **Port 139/tcp ‚Äì netbios-ssn**
- **Name**: NetBIOS Session Service
- **Purpose**: Legacy protocol used for file and printer sharing in Windows.
- **Risks**:
  - Can expose system name, user names, and more.
  - Can be used in LLMNR/NBT-NS poisoning attacks.
- **Recommendation**:
  - Disable NetBIOS over TCP/IP if not needed.
  - Use SMBv2/v3 and modern alternatives.

---

### üîπ **Port 445/tcp ‚Äì microsoft-ds**
- **Name**: Microsoft Directory Services (SMB)
- **Purpose**: Handles file sharing, network logins, and Active Directory communication.
- **Risks**:
  - Target for ransomware like WannaCry and EternalBlue.
  - Exposes file shares to the network.
- **Recommendation**:
  - Disable SMBv1 protocol.
  - Use firewalls to limit exposure.
  - Never expose port 445 to the internet.
